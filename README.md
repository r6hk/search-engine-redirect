## What is it for?

**Scenario 1:** In Google Chrome and other browsers, when your default search engine is set to Google, you get search suggestions as you type, like this:

However, if you set a custom search engine, these suggestions often stop working! 😥

With this script, you can keep Google as your default search engine to enjoy search suggestions, and then automatically redirect to your preferred search engine! 🥰

**Scenario 2:** When using the Windows taskbar search, the default search engine is Bing, and Microsoft doesn't allow you to change it! 😥 With this script, you can redirect Bing searches to any search engine you like! 🥰
